#Assignment 2 README

##Implementation:
* To the best of my knowledge, everything has been correctly implemented.
* For the future: I would like to make it so that when you close one window, it
automatically closes all windows regardless of type. Currently, windows of
the same type close when you open windows of the same type (i.e. landmark window
and landmark window), but not so for cross type windows.

##Collaborators:
* Haversine Javascript implementation is from Stacked Overflow link given to us
